# Metatron's Cube Classifier

This project explores the intersection of art and machine learning by building a visually inspired neural network. The architecture draws inspiration from the geometry of Metatron's Cube.

## Features
- **Cool Geometry**: Nodes and layers reflect the structure of Metatron's Cube.
- **Minimal Functionality**: Focus is on aesthetics, not optimization.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore the network's structure.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Scripts and datasets.
- `src/`: Model, training, and visualization code.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Generate data: `python data/generate_data.py`
3. Train model: `python src/train.py`
4. Visualize network: `python src/visualize.py`
